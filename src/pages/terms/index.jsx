          {" "}
          The CPS test is a free online game that measures a number of clicks
          per second. The click speed test consists of calculating your click
          speed with your mouse over a given time, which will give you a result
          in "CPS".
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          To start, click on "Start the click speed test". The timer starts with
          the first click, so you have to place the mouse on the area, put your
          hand on it, and click as quickly as possible on the same area during
          the time allotted to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          A timer will count down from the first click to the time that you have
          left to play. You will be given a 5 second time interval as a default
          to practice, but you can adjust the time and default options in the
          menu.
        </p>

          How is the score calculated in the CPS?
        </h2>
        <p>
          {" "}
          Once the test time has elapsed, you will be able to obtain your final
          score which will be presented in CPS (clicks per second). This result
          in CPS calculates the average number of clicks made compared to the
          duration of the CPS tester; i.e. a ratio of the number of clicks by
          the number of seconds played (CPS = number of clicks / number of
          seconds). The faster you click your mouse, the higher the CPS counter
          will score.
        </p>
        <h2 className="more-pages-title">
          How should I choose the time interval for the click test?{" "}
        </h2>
        <p>
          To maximize your chances of receiving high scores and achieve the
          fastest clicks per second, choose a time interval of 5 seconds. 5
          seconds is the time set as a default and will allow you to obtain the
          best CPS scores that you can. With any other selection of time beyond
          the default of 5 seconds, the CPS tester will not be able to provide
          you with the most accurate result to your capabilities. I consider 5
          seconds to be the most appropriate amount of time to test as anything
          longer will result in your finger being slowed down over time. It is
          best to use the lesser interval for the most accurate results.
        </p>
        <p>
          My CPS tester is free and can be taken as many times as you would
          like. To restart, click on the "Try again" button and you can practice
          several times to try to improve your score and your click speed
          ability. A score of 6 to 9 clicks per second is considered to be a
          good click speed and is the average scored rating. Did you know that
          the world record was 14.1 CPS, according to Google? Take part in the
          speed clicker test experiment and be prepared to compete with
          formidable players, and beat the best scores on the net!

        <h2 className="more-pages-title"> My tips for always clicking</h2>
        <p>
          faster I have a few helpful tips for you to achieve the best scores
          possible. There are techniques and body positions that allow you to
          always click faster. To date, several methods are recognized to help
          you improve your speed of clicks, but the best advice I can give you
          is to always have your hand relaxed. By using two fingers, you can
          become even faster. Make sure that the distance between your finger
          and the mouse are minimal to save time and increase the amount of
          possible clicks. Be sure to press the button gently and not too hard
          as you may cause the mouse to move and slow down the frequency of the
          clicks.
        </p>
        <p>
          My last recommendation would be to consider the kind of mouse that
          you are working with. I recommend that you bring a specialized gaming
          mouse that will help you increase your click rate by being more
          flexible and more suitable. Make sure your mouse is correctly
          installed and is fully optimized for its sensitivity settings to be
          able to participate in my CPS test. And, be aware that the keypad
          touch screen of a laptop computer is less powerful than a mouse.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to note to my users that you may benefit from a
          strong internet connection. As the test is played online, it is
          necessary to have a stable internet connection.
